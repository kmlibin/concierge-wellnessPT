        Dr. Christian Wade, a native of Fort Worth, TX, discovered his passion
        for helping others at an early age, inspired by his experience growing
        up with an older brother who has Cerebral Palsy. The countless hours
        spent attending physical therapy sessions, participating in church
        groups, and engaging in local events exposed him to the challenges faced
        by individuals with disabilities, igniting a desire to make a positive
        impact. 
        <br /> <br />
        Choosing a path away from traditional medication-based
        solutions, Dr. Wade found his calling in physical therapy after
        personally experiencing the benefits following an injury. His
        educational journey culminated in the attainment of a Doctorate from Texas Women's University in
        Dallas. Eager to broaden his perspective, he embarked on a two-year
        journey, working in five different states across over 10 physical
        therapy clinics. 
        <br /> <br />
        These diverse experiences not only enriched Dr. Wade's
        understanding of the healthcare system but also exposed him to various
        management styles and treatment approaches. Recognizing the need for a
        paradigm shift towards a more holistic and preventative healthcare
        model, Dr. Wade took a bold step by establishing his own practice. 
        <br /> <br />
        At the heart of his mission is a commitment to not merely alleviate pain
        but to empower individuals to embrace healthier lifestyles, reducing the
        reliance on unnecessary medical interventions. Dr. Wade firmly believes
        in the body's innate capacity to heal with proper nutrition, exercise,
        and overall wellness. This holistic philosophy permeates every aspect of
        his patient care. 
        <br /> <br />
        By standing at the forefront of change, Dr. Wade is
        pushing the healthcare profession in a positive direction. His practice
        emphasizes evidence-based treatment, skilled manual therapy, and
        comprehensive patient education, reflecting his dedication to shaping a
        healthcare landscape that prioritizes holistic well-being and
        prevention. 
        <br /> <br />
        Currently living in Colorado with his wife and child, they
        relish in the beauty of the Rocky Mountains. Their days are filled with
        shared passions, including hiking, mountain biking, camping,
        snowboarding, and fostering a healthy lifestyle through their home gym.
        These activities not only contribute to their physical well-being but
        also reinforce their commitment to the holistic principles that guide
        his approach to healthcare. 
        <br /> <br />
        Join Dr. Christian Wade on the journey to a
        healthier, more balanced life, where your body's natural healing
        abilities are nurtured, and each patient is empowered to take charge of
        their well-being.

    header: "Why Physical Therapy?",
    contentOne: (

        Ten years ago, while in college, I had a gnarly back injury that left me
        unable to get out of bed for two days. I had a long history of low back
        discomfort, but this was bad. It was scary, and I felt hopeless. The
        hopelessness only increased when my campus RN gave me a printout of
        exercises from the 1980s and told me not to lift more than 5 pounds…
        think about everyday items that weigh more than 5 pounds. I now know
        this advice is ridiculous. <br /> <br />
        My journey in the traditional medical model had started. I went to PT
        and did stretches, clamshells, and bridges. Over time, my pain and
        function improved, but I couldn’t nearly function as I could before. I
        was depressed with my lack of function, and I wanted answers. I got an
        MRI showing I had three herniations. Testing gave me relief, knowing I
        wasn’t imagining this pain, but it made me believe I was fragile. I
        tried injections, traction, dry needling, massage, you name it. I even
        turned to alcohol to numb the pain. I still had significant back pain,
        and my day-to-day life as a college student had drastically changed. No
        longer were the five days/week in the gym and pickup basketball three
        days/week.

        It wasn’t until one of my physical therapists and later mentors told me
        I needed to start getting back to my old hobbies. I was scared and
        angry, as if she didn’t believe me, but she was right. Over time, I
        gradually started doing the things I feared, and it only improved. Then,
        I went through PT school myself and found great colleagues and mentors
        along the way. Four years into being a Doctor of PT, one of my
        continuing education courses I took nailed it with its loading
        principles. I had avoided heavy lifting for so long… but that’s exactly
        what I needed. Now, whenever my back bothers me, or I’m achy after a
        long day at work or sitting in the car, I deadlift! I’ve found that
        weightlifting and staying active is the only thing that keeps my back
        pain at bay and makes me feel good, strong, and capable.
