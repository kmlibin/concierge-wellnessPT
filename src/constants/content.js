    contentOne: (<div>Ten years ago, while in college, I had a gnarly back injury that left me unable to get out of bed for two days. I had a long history of low back discomfort, but this was bad. It was scary, and I felt hopeless. The hopelessness only increased when my campus RN gave me a printout of exercises from the 1980s and told me not to lift more than 5 pounds… think about everyday items that weigh more than 5 pounds. I now know this advice is ridiculous. <br /> <br />
        My journey in the traditional medical model had started. I went to PT and did stretches, clamshells, and bridges. Over time, my pain and function improved, but I couldn’t nearly function as I could before. I was depressed with my lack of function, and I wanted answers. I got an MRI showing I had three herniations. Testing gave me relief, knowing I wasn’t imagining this pain, but it made me believe I was fragile. I tried injections, traction, dry needling, massage, you name it. I even turned to alcohol to numb the pain. I still had significant back pain, and my day-to-day life as a college student had drastically changed. 
        No longer were the five days/week in the gym and pickup basketball three days/week.</div>),
    contentTwo: `It wasn’t until one of my physical therapists and later mentors told me I needed to start getting back to my old hobbies. I was scared and angry, as if she didn’t believe me, but she was right. Over time, I gradually started doing the things I feared, and it only improved. Then, I went through PT school myself and found great colleagues and mentors along the way. Four years into being a Doctor of PT, one of my continuing education courses I took nailed it with its loading principles. I had avoided heavy lifting for so long… but that’s exactly what I needed.
        Now, whenever my back bothers me, or I’m achy after a long day at work or sitting in the car, I deadlift! I’ve found that weightlifting and staying active is the only thing that keeps my back pain at bay and makes me feel good, strong, and capable.`,
