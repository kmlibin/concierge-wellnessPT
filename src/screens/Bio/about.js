        Dr. Christian Wade, a native of Fort Worth, TX, discovered his passion
        for helping others at an early age, inspired by his experience growing
        up with an older brother who has Cerebral Palsy. The countless hours
        spent attending physical therapy sessions, participating in church
        groups, and engaging in local events exposed him to the challenges faced
        by individuals with disabilities, igniting a desire to make a positive
        impact. 
        <br /> <br />
        Choosing a path away from traditional medication-based
        solutions, Dr. Wade found his calling in physical therapy after
        personally experiencing the benefits following an injury. His
        educational journey culminated in the attainment of a Doctorate from Texas Woman's University in
        Dallas. Eager to broaden his perspective, he embarked on a two-year
        journey, working in five different states across over 10 physical
        therapy clinics. 
        <br /> <br />
        These diverse experiences not only enriched Dr. Wade's
        understanding of the healthcare system but also exposed him to various
        management styles and treatment approaches. Recognizing the need for a
        paradigm shift towards a more holistic and preventative healthcare
        model, Dr. Wade took a bold step by establishing his own practice. 
        <br /> <br />
        At the heart of his mission is a commitment to not merely alleviate pain
        but to empower individuals to embrace healthier lifestyles, reducing the
        reliance on unnecessary medical interventions. Dr. Wade firmly believes
        in the body's innate capacity to heal with proper nutrition, exercise,
        and overall wellness. This holistic philosophy permeates every aspect of
        his patient care. 
        <br /> <br />
        By standing at the forefront of change, Dr. Wade is
        pushing the healthcare profession in a positive direction. His practice
        emphasizes evidence-based treatment, skilled manual therapy, and
        comprehensive patient education, reflecting his dedication to shaping a
        healthcare landscape that prioritizes holistic well-being and
        prevention. 
        <br /> <br />
        Currently living in Colorado with his wife and child, they
        relish in the beauty of the Rocky Mountains. Their days are filled with
        shared passions, including hiking, mountain biking, camping,
        snowboarding, and fostering a healthy lifestyle through their home gym.
        These activities not only contribute to their physical well-being but
        also reinforce their commitment to the holistic principles that guide
        his approach to healthcare.
