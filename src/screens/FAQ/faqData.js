    question: "What do you specialize in?",
    answer: `Although I confidently treat a wide variety of orthopedic conditions, I tend to gravitate towards action 
      sport and combat sport athletes. I always enjoyed traditional sports but nothing gave me the rush more 
      than action sports. I started with skateboarding, then BMX, then motocross all while taking annual trips
       to snowboard and getting on friend’s boats for a wakeboard session whenever possible. I turned to wrestling 
       in highschool and went on to boxing my senior year instead of playing football. While I traveled 
       as a PT I worked with action sport athletes all over the country and now living in CO I have access to 
       premier ski/snowboard areas and some of the best mountain biking trails around. I feel it’s important to 
       truly know the sport that your clients are participating in and be able to 
      relate with the internal drive pushing them towards perfection and that next adrenaline rush.`,

    question: `What is dry needling?`,
    answer: `Dry needling is a therapeutic 
    technique that involves the insertion of thin, solid needles into specific points in the body, known as myofascial trigger 
    points to stimulate a healing response. Unlike acupuncture, which is rooted in traditional Chinese medicine and focuses 
    on balancing the body's energy flow, dry needling is a Western medicine technique primarily used to improve tissue health, 
    decrease pain, and improve muscle function.`,
