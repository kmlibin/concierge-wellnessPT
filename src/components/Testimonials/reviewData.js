    content: `Working with Christian Wade from Concierge Wellness has been a game-changer for me. From our very first session, it was clear that Christian isn’t just any physical therapist. He genuinely cares about his clients and goes above and beyond to offer solutions tailored to individual needs.
      Choosing the cash payment option simplified everything for me, removing the usual insurance-related stress. What truly touched me was Christian's willingness to travel and ensure I was comfortable in my own environment. This personalized touch made a world of difference.
      Beyond his exceptional skills, Christian has this incredible way of explaining complex concepts. Before meeting him, many aspects of physical therapy felt like they were in a foreign language. But he broke everything down, ensuring I understood every step of my treatment. This not only helped me physically but gave me peace of mind.
      I can't express enough how grateful I am for Christian’s dedication and expertise. If you're considering physical therapy, look no further than Concierge Wellness. It's not just about the therapy; it's about the personal touch and genuine care.`,

    content: `Christian, DPT has been awesome from the beginning of my treatment. Listens to my concerns and what I feel like needs to be better or what is going well and he always has my best interest in mind. Works towards my goals and always has patient-centered care. He is personable and meets me where I am every day I am there. Pushes me to do better within my limits and is always encouraging. 
    I have never felt judgment coming in if I hadn't met my goal or got behind on my workouts. He is just as encouraging and understanding. I'm so thankful he has been my PT!!!`,
