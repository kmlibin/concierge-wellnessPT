        Working with Christian Wade from Concierge Wellness has been a
        game-changer for me. From our very first session, it was clear that
        Christian isn't just any physical therapist. He genuinely cares about
        his clients and goes above and beyond to offer solutions tailored to
        individual needs. Choosing the cash payment option simplified everything
        for me, removing the usual insurance-related stress. What truly touched
        me was Christian's willingness to travel and ensure I was comfortable in
        my own environment. This personalized touch made a world of difference.

        Beyond his exceptional skills, Christian has this incredible way of
        explaining complex concepts. Before meeting him, many aspects of
        physical therapy felt like they were in a foreign language. But he broke
        everything down, ensuring I understood every step of my treatment. This
        not only helped me physically but gave me peace of mind. I can't express
        enough how grateful I am for Christian's dedication and expertise. If
        you're considering physical therapy, look no further than Concierge
        Wellness. It's not just about the therapy; it's about the personal touch
        and genuine care.

    I could tell that he genuinely cares about his clients lives and overall wellbeing and doesn’t just try to get 
    them in and out the door. He helped me with an ankle injury, and even though I had to do my meetings over zoom, 
    I felt more comfortable and taken care of with him than the people that I tried to see in-person. We met virtually, 
    and Christian was able to give me at-home exercises that were helpful and healing, and he was very intentional with 
    asking questions and understanding exactly where I’m at even when he couldn’t be there in person. 
    If I ever have any injuries again, Christian will for sure be the first person I call to set up PT.`,

    content: `Christian, DPT has been awesome from the beginning of my treatment. Listens to my concerns and what I feel like needs 
    to be better or what is going well and he always has my best interest in mind. Works towards my goals and always has 
    patient-centered care. He is personable and meets me where I am every day I am there. 
    Pushes me to do better within my limits and is always encouraging. 
    I have never felt judgment coming in if I hadn't met my goal or got behind on my workouts. He is just as encouraging and 
    understanding. I'm so thankful he has been my PT!!!`,

        Christian was my first point of contact after a stress fracture in my
        foot...because I was a fool and didn't go to PT right away, I also wound
        up with a nasty case of IT Band Syndrome. As an active person and avid
        trail runner, I was itching to get back to training as soon as possible
        and I wouldn't have been able to do it without Christian's guidance and
        expertise. He pinpointed some weaknesses and gave me recommendations and
        exercises to correct imbalances so that I would rehab correctly.
        Christian recommended Dry Needling for my knee, and even though I was a
        little nervous about it (I mean, needles, come on) the relief was almost
        immediate.

        The most impressive thing about working with Christian is his
        willingness to collaborate and learn. He went out of his way to dig into
        more material about what could be causing my knee pain and how it could
        be corrected. He also talked to other running specialists and PTs to
        help him make the best decisions about my rehab. I can't tell you how
        much I appreciate this humility. Plus, he made it very easy to schedule
        and he provides in-home treatment. He's clearly committed to patient
        care and learning as much as he can about his field!

    content: `Doctor Wade has helped not only me, but one of my adult children - both virtually. Christian gave me exercises to 
    help strengthen my ankle after I broke it with a fall. He definitely helped me get back on the ski slopes through 
    strength training and stretching. The movement in my left foot/ankle now matches the right (which is a HUGE improvement).
     More importantly, Christian helped our daughter with a foot injury she had overseas. He treated her virtually (over zoom). 
     It was such a blessing to her to have Christian’s care and expertise and he definitely helped her strengthen and heal. 
     While some doctors indicated surgery might be needed, it was Christian who insisted she be patient and persistent with her exercises. 
     It worked! I highly recommend Dr Wade. If you can’t meet with him in person, he will virtually find a way to help.  `,
